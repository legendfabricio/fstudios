        <h2>Kaypan Civil War (Episode 1)</h2>
        
          <p>Birds are singing, flowers are blooming, as the world is in peace. However, some people does not like the current Kaypa government, and these are the socialists.</p>
          <p>So, they plan to invade Kaypa and cause a civil war. But how will they grow their party, you may ask? Well, with propagandas, of course.</p>
          <p>With enough propagandas and people, they finally decide to invade Kaypa by the province of Latipa, and they kind of did a good job</p>
          <p>But they were not the only ones who wanted the power of the government: there was the French Rebels.</p>
          <p>The French Rebels also revolted against the government, in the province of Guhai. but since they were weak, they were short-lived</p>
          <p>The Socialists fails to revolt, and some time later the French Rebels also falls, making the war end.</p>

        <h2>Kaypan Civil War (Episode 2)</h2> 

          <p>A month later the Kaypan Civil War ended, with the Kaypan victory, the Socialists still didn't gave up.</p>
          <p>The Socialists did a lot more of propaganda to expand their thing and tried to be stronger in military than Kaypa.</p>
          <p>The war starts, with the Socialists having a stronger military. They already take alot of land.</p>
          <p>French Kaypa, hoping to get their independence again, gets advantage of the second civil war and revolts too.</p>
          <p>Carnicanus helps Kaypa by sending to them resources for the war</p>
          <p>But then, Anuix interferes in the war to gain territory, and actually does it.</p>
          <p>Carnicanus quits sending resources and helps Kaypa</p>
          <p>French Kaypa gets their independence as they wanted, but that would not go for too long.</p>
          <p>Anuix declares war at French Kaypa and invades through all direction. and so French Kaypa turns into Anuixian Kaypa.</p>
          <p>Guhai and some territory were lost, and the Socialists won, declaring the loss of the Kaypan government.</p>

          <p>Kaypa 2 was made in 12 January, 2023. The total frames was 1mb (25 frames)</p>
